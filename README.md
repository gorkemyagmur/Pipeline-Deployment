## Pipeline-Deployment


### In this project written in the Python language, data analysis and a pipeline constructed based on the Titanic Dataset obtained from kaggle.com have been integrated into a web interface using the Flask library with HTML and CSS. User logins made through this site are stored in a PostgreSQL database with the Flask and PostgreSQL connection for each prediction made.
